Print Desk
===================

This is where all print jobs are executed (i.e where they get printed).

This system should be installed on a computer attached to a printer in the library.

Note: The code does not take into consideration any standard approach or design patterns

and mostly contains what most calls SPAGHETTI code.

Run the commands below

    $ cd /dev/www/
    $ git clone https://github.com/leocss/elibrary-print-desk.git
    $ cd elibrary-print-desk
